# Audio Classification  ðŸ—£
Audio classification is a fundamental problem in the field of audio processing. It is a challenging problem because there is no clear definition of what is a good representation of audio data. In this project, we will use a custom dataset to classify audio files into 17 classes.Identify sounds in audio clips using Tensorflow and pydub ðŸ—£
